            The Primera División, commonly known as La Liga and as La Liga Santander for sponsorship reasons, is the top
            professional association football division of the Spanish football league system. Administrated by the Liga
            de Fútbol Profesional (LFP), La Liga is contested by 20 teams, with the three lowest-placed teams relegated
            to the Segunda División and replaced by the top two teams in that division plus the winner of a play-off.
        </p>
        <p>
            A total of 60 teams have competed in La Liga since its inception. Nine teams have been crowned champions,
            with Real Madrid winning the title a record 32 times and Barcelona 24 times. Real Madrid dominated the
            championship from the 1950s through the 1980s. From the 1990s onwards, Barcelona (14 titles) and Real Madrid
            (7 titles) both dominated, though La Liga also saw other champions, including Atlético Madrid, Valencia, and
            Deportivo de La Coruña. In more recent years, Atlético Madrid has joined a coalition of now three teams
            dominating La Liga alongside Real Madrid and Barcelona.
        </p>
        <p>
            According to UEFA's league coefficient, La Liga has been the top league in Europe over the last five years,
            and has produced the continent's top-rated club more times (18) than any other league, double that of
            second-placed Serie A. Its clubs have won the most UEFA Champions League (16), UEFA Europa League (10), UEFA
            Super Cup (13), and FIFA Club World Cup (5) titles, and its players have accumulated the highest number of
            (FIFA) Ballon d'Or awards (19).
        </p>
        <p>
            La Liga is one of the most popular professional sports leagues in the world, with an average attendance of
            26,741 for league matches in the 2014–15 season. This is the sixth-highest of any domestic professional
            sports league in the world and the fourth-highest of any professional association football league in the
            world, behind the Bundesliga, the Premier League, and the Indian Super League.
