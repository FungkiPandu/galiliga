        Serie A, also called Serie A TIM due to sponsorship by Telecom Italia, is a professional league competition
        for football clubs located at the top of the Italian football league system and has been operating for over
        eighty years since the 1929–30 season. It had been organized by Lega Calcio until 2010, but a new league,
        the Lega Serie A, was created for the 2010–11 season. Serie A is regarded as one of the best football
        leagues in the world. Serie A was considered the best league in the world in the '90s, and has produced the
        highest number of European Cup finalists: Italian clubs have reached the final of the competition on a
        record twenty-six different occasions, winning the title twelve times. Serie A is ranked 4th among European
        leagues according to UEFA's league coefficient behind the Spanish La Liga, English Premier League and German
        Bundesliga, which is based on the performance of Italian clubs in the Champions League and the Europa
        League. It also ranked 5th in world according to the first trends of the 2011 IFFHS rating.

        In its current format, the Italian Football Championship was revised from having regional and interregional
        rounds, to a single-tier league from the 1929–30 season onwards. The championship titles won prior to 1929
        are officially recognised by FIGC with the same weighting as titles that were subsequently awarded. However,
        the 1945–46 season, when the league was played over two geographical groups due to the ravages of WWII, is
        not statistically considered, even if its title is fully official.
