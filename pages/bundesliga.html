        The Bundesliga was founded in 1962 in Dortmund and the first season started in 1963. The structure and
        organisation of the Bundesliga along with Germany's other football leagues have undergone frequent changes
        right up to the present day. The Bundesliga was originally founded by the Deutscher Fußball-Bund (English:
        German Football Association), but is now operated by the Deutsche Fußball Liga (English: German Football
        League).
